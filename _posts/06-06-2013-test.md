Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard.

I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? ♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪ Heart attack never stopped old big bear. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? It's a wonderful restaurant!
