<p>Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. It looks like you&#39;ve been looking for dragons… in the future. If you didn&#39;t have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn&#39;t mind giving you a little sugar. There&#39;s been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn&#39;t make that in three months. Come on! ♪♪ It&#39;s The Final Countdown ♪♪ Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it&#39;s the opposite. It&#39;s like my heart is getting hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? ♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there&#39;s another rainbow… ♪♪ Heart attack never stopped old big bear. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it&#39;s hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. ♪♪ It&#39;s The Final Countdown ♪♪ How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? It&#39;s a wonderful restaurant!</p>
