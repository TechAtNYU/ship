		What is Tech@NYU?
		Tech@NYU wants students to build stuff together. It takes a lot of scars, experience, and bad ideas to finally get to a great product, so Tech@NYU is like a big sandbox - a place for experimentation, play, and, well, shipping.

		We do a lot of events too - monthly DemoDays where we show off our work, weekly HackDays where we learn together, and semiannual Startup Weeks where we listen to some big-name speakers.

		If you're a student in New York City that's interested in the intersection of startups, entrepreneurship, coding, art and design - we want you to join us.

		If you're an NYC startup looking to give back to the student community, we also want to find ways you can help.
