Tech@NYU is a student-led entrepreneurship club at NYU that thinks students need to build stuff. Lots of stuff. Sitting around and talking about the stuff doesn't count, winning contests with the stuff doesn't count, only shipping the stuff counts.

##Ship often. Ship lousy stuff, but ship. Ship constantly.
-Seth Godin

This is a list of the stuff Tech@NYU members and alumni have shipped.
