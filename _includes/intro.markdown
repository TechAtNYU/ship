#What is DemoDays?
DemoDays is all about fostering a community of students who create things. We invite students from all over NYC to show off a hack or a project that theyâ€™ve been working on. Many students are working on incredible projects but often lack a platform to show them off. We want to provide a platform for student builders to present their work, to celebrate their creations, and let that inspire other students to build projects they care about.
