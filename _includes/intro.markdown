Tech@NYU is NYC's largest student-run organization of hackers, designers, and builders. We think students need to build stuff. Lots of stuff. Sitting around and talking about the stuff doesn't count, winning contests with the stuff doesn't count, only shipping the stuff counts.

##Ship often. Ship lousy stuff, but ship. Ship constantly.
-Seth Godin

This is what DemoDays participants, Tech@NYU board members, and alumni have shipped.
